Add a 2-tier navigation menu that includes the links shown above. Format the navigation
menu so the link for the page that’s currently displayed (in this case, home) has orange
text, and so the link that the mouse is hovering over (in this case, indoor) has a gray
background. Format the links in the sidebar as a vertical navigation menu as shown above. Be sure to
make the entire box for each link clickable.Modify the image in the main content so it’s a link that displays the same page as the link
below it.
